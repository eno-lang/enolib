# enolib

Standard library for parsing, validating and inspecting eno documents

## Compatibility notice

enolib supports the not yet ratified [final specification](https://github.com/eno-lang/eno/tree/master/rfcs-final-spec) for eno. You are however much encouraged to use it in your projects already, this helps us all to gather insights on whether there are any remaining flaws in the proposed final specifications (you're very welcome to report such issues if you encounter them).

Also, asides the formal specification perspective and from a practical point of view there are not likely any major changes ahead, so unless you build your application around edge cases of the most exotic features in the language you should be perfectly safe and future-proof as well.

## Release status

enolib was freshly released for javascript, expect news on the python, ruby, and php implementations in the coming weeks.
