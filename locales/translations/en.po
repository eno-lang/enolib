# Message locale 'en' (English)
#
# Note to translators:
# The first message group ('terminology') contains the wording for the basic building blocks of eno,
# take extra care to translate these few items exceptionally well, also taking the liberty to partially
# or fully keep the english terms if there are no deeply meaningful, accurate and customary translations
# for the given concept in your language.
#
# With this foundation laid out well, you will find the rest of the translations to be merely
# repetitive finger exercises. :)

# Thank you for your contibution; to success!
